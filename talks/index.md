by Guillaume Prigent, Adrien Barchapt

Come on and do it yourself immersed in a real infrastructure and with your own network (hns-platform based).
The objective of this workshop is to show, step by step, how an attacker is able to implement these exploits and how to try to limit the damage (or not) on real and virtual device (SIEMENS, SCHNEIDER, ALLEN-BRADLEY, ...).

Do it yourself ! - Technical labs

Led by Guillaume Prigent and Adrien Barchapt, just implement yourself IT and SCADA network operation with metasploit framework, nmap NSE and IDS/IPS with suricata following different use-cases:

 * Nmap NSE modbus discover;
 * PLC Scan;
 * Metasploit TCP / Modbus - Schneider Remote Start / Stop;
    #1 from attack to signature with suricata IDS;
    #2 from signature to attack with Metapsloit :
        Build your own auxliary module for TCP/Modbus force listen only command

Prerequisites:

* Laptop with Windows 32/64 bits or Linux 64 bits only (Debian wheezy, Debian jessie, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 14.10, Ubuntu 15.10, Kali Linux) with a RJ45 Gigabit NIC (required !).
* A virtualbox OVA is also available in case your OS is not supported by hns-platform. Please check that your CPU supports virtualization technology
